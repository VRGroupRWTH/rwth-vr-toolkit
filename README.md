# RWTH VR Toolkit
The **RWTH VR Toolkit** contains a collection of extensions which are used in many of our applications. It serves as a tool to implement virtual reality applications which work on desktop, HMD and room-mounted devices.
The contents of this plugin are constantly extended and improved to reflect changes in the Unreal nDisplay Plugin that we use to support our aixCAVE with Unreal.
